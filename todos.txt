# TODOs / improvements 

For monte-carlo / markov:
    - Modify file reader to discretize notes (if discretizing into quarter notes, a whole note will have 
            sequence of 4 vectors)
    - Modify file reader to include pauses (encoded separately in our vector)
    - Modify state representation to use intervals
