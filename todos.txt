# TODOs / improvements 

For monte-carlo / markov:
    - DONE: Modify file reader to discretize notes (if discretizing into quarter notes, a whole note will have 
            sequence of 4 vectors)
    - DONE: Modify file reader to include pauses (encoded separately in our vector)
    - MAYBELATER: Modify state representation to use intervals
    - TODO: Add constraints while generating, so that there's not too much silence/repetition

For general infrastructure:
    - Clean up midi reading, use a common base class if possible, try NoteSequence from magenta 
    - Create filtered dataset for only files with clear melodies, improve on reading files having mutiple chords etc.

Baseline Char-RNN based sequence generation:
    - TODO: Make V1 Char-RNN melody generation (with polyphonic encoding)
    - TODO: Try magenta models on dataset
